# Command History
In this challenge we learn that how the shell saves history of the commands that you invoke.here we just have to use out up/down arrow keys 
to check our histroy of commands where the flag is hidden.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{spZ7dJWkomSyiYK7aJocCH0Jg9-.0lNzEzNxwiM1kjNzEzW}`

We just have to use our up/down arrow keys to find the flag, as according to the challenge the flag is hidden in the history.

```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ here is your flag: pwn.college{spZ7dJWkomSyiYK7aJocCH0Jg9-.0lNzEzNxwiM1kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt that the shell has history and we can use up/down arrow keys to check our history of commands in the terminal.I aslo learnt that there is a command called "histroy",
which when invoked displays a list of previously executed commands during a terminal session.
