# Intro To Arguments
This challenge is about using a command with arguments,which is basically called additional data passed to commands.In this challenge we have to run the hello command
with a single argument of hackers.

## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{gECja5ZH-TiMcPKVJeTkxpFCndx.QX4YjM1wiM1kjNzEzW}

Run the hello command with a single argument hacker to get the flag.

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8yVf40kJCDaZBu31EvwbUtRcKrK.QX4YjM1wCMxAzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learnt how a command can have multiple arguments and how we can have different outputs according the different arguments.Then I learnt about the echo command
which basically "echoes" all of its arguments back out onto the terminal. 
For example: 
'''hacker@dojo:~$ echo Hello Hackers!
Hello Hackers!
'''
