# Rdirecting output

In this challenge, we have to use output redirection to write the word PWN to the filename COLLEGE.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UD0vuZx1N0KFA3hEYrxoPrCVIjF.QX0YTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}`
As given in the challenge we have to use output redirection to get the flag. Therefore i used echo PWN > COLLEGE.
```
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your 
flag:
pwn.college{UD0vuZx1N0KFA3hEYrxoPrCVIjF.QX0YTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}
```
