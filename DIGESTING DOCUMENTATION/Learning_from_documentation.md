# Learning from documentation

In this challenge we need to pass the correct argument to /challenge/challenge to get the flag.


## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wLRZw_T7SK3Xf1-PBcXbXRl_9sx.QX0ITO0wiM1kjNzEzW}`

As given in this challenge we need to pass the right argument which is --giveflag through the /challenge/challenge program to get the flag

```
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wLRZw_T7SK3Xf1-PBcXbXRl_9sx.QX0ITO0wiM1kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt the need and uses of a documentation for a certain program and learnt how useful documentations are, I also learnt that how the correct usage 
of programs depends,in a large part, on the proper specification of arguments to them.

## References 
None.
