# Chaining wiht semicolons

In this challenge we need to run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, chaining them with a semicolon.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UhxJw8jFrpJ1VZH_8xV4mtWXc9q.QX1UDO0wiM1kjNzEzW}`

As the challenge suggests we can use ; to chain two commands

```
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UhxJw8jFrpJ1VZH_8xV4mtWXc9q.QX1UDO0wiM1kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

I learnt that how we cn chain commands using semicolon.

## References
