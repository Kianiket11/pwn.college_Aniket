# Implicit relative paths
In this challeng we need to run /challenge/run using a relative path while having a current working directory of /. 
Hint given: Your relative path starts with the letter c.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gVausVJdjMkWr1lnNrZ7MG9apZK.QX5QTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}`

Now as our current working directory for solving this challenge is /. Therefore, Firstly we need to enter the working directory
/ using cd /. Now when i entered the working directory the next thing i did was run /challenge/run as i forgot that we had to use 
the relative path but then afterwards i used challenge/run which is a relative path. 

```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You invoked this challenge with an absolute path. This challenge needs a relative path!
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gVausVJdjMkWr1lnNrZ7MG9apZK.QX5QTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
This challenge reminded me the difference between absolute path and relative path.I also learnt that the relative path
entirely depends upon out current working directory(cwd).

## References 
None.
