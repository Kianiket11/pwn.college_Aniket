# Implicit Relative Path
In this challenge we need to explicitly use relative paths to launch run in this scenario.To do this
we need to tell Linux that we explicitly want to execute a program in the current directory, using (.) .

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QCPx-cufSua_k-Px_0cWwTmsQIT.QXxUTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}`
Now This challenge asks us to launch run using (.) and in this case our current working directory(cwd) was challenge. 
So, Firstly i went into our cwd using cd /challenge. Now i used .challenge/run as forgot that i was already in the 
challenge directory. I corrected my mistake and ran ./run as we need to use (.).

```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ .challenge/run
bash: .challenge/run: No such file or directory
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QCPx-cufSua_k-Px_0cWwTmsQIT.QXxUTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

I learnt that if Linux searched the current directory for programs every time we entera naked path, we could 
accidentally execute programs in our current directory that happened to have the same names as core system utilities.

## References 
None.
