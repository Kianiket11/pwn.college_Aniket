# Position yet elsewhere 
This challenge asks us to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path(which a certain directory which it will tell us.
And we'll have to cd the directory to find the path.


## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{87JKjHboujRa1PtfQgGYTYHHAFD.QX4QTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}`
Basically did the same thing here also which we weredoing for the previous two problems.

```
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /home
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/home$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/gnu directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/home$ cd /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/gnu
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/gnu$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{87JKjHboujRa1PtfQgGYTYHHAFD.QX4QTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}

```

## What I learned
I'll take it as a practice problem, therefore didn't learn somethiong new but due to these two problems i am starting to feel 
confident in linux. As now i am able to understand what is written in the terminal and i am able to solve the challenges at a 
faster rate.
