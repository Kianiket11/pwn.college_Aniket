# Explicit Relative Paths
In this challenge we need to run /challenge/run using a relative path while having a current working directory of / but we have to use 
. in our relative paths.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{k2Jk4g4UGd-ZQtMxwFxdaSd4Mna.QXwUTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}`

Now, as i started the challenge i had few things in mind firstly we had to enter the root directory(/).As it will be our working
directory so i uded cd / to enter in it. Now the challenge suggests that we had to use . in our relative paths. As, nothing came 
to my mind i started using the hit and try method and started to relate it to the previous challenge i did. But then after a hint 
i got that we have to ./challenge/run (as it was mentioned in the starting of the challenge that we had to use . in our relative paths.

```
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge
bash: ./challenge: Is a directory
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./
bash: ./: Is a directory
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Incorrect...
This challenge must be called with a relative path that explicitly starts with a `.`!
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ .challenge/run
bash: .challenge/run: No such file or directory
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ .challenge
bash: .challenge: command not found
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge
bash: ./challenge: Is a directory
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!!
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{k2Jk4g4UGd-ZQtMxwFxdaSd4Mna.QXwUTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}

```

## What I learned
i learnt that in the previous problem our relative path was "naked": it directly specified the directory to descend into from the current
directory. I learnt that in most of the operating systems including linux there are two iplicit entries that we can reference in paths: 
(.) and (..).  ., refers right to the same directory, so the following absolute paths are all identical to each other. while .. denotes the parent 
directory (the directory that contains the current directory) and also allows you to move “up” in the directory tree.
