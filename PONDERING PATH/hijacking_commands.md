# Hijacking commands 

## My solve
**Flag:** ``


```
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
Found 'rm' command at /run/dojo/bin/rm. Executing!
Uh oh, looks like I successfully removed the flag! That means you did not 
properly set PATH to keep me from finding 'rm'. Since the flag is gone, you 
will need to re-launch the challenge from the module page! Better luck next 
time.
