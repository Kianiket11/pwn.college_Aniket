# The PATH variable


## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EDWBORz7_HTFF1y7_n6imuEdxKs.QX2cDM1wiM1kjNzEzW}`


```
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ PATH="/challenge/run"
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
/challenge/run: line 4: rm: command not found
The flag is still there! I might as well give it to you!
pwn.college{EDWBORz7_HTFF1y7_n6imuEdxKs.QX2cDM1wiM1kjNzEzW}
