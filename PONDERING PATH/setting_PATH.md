# Setting PATH


## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ov5WzvgMiM_iKEJqKV4oDY4guJA.QX1cjM1wiM1kjNzEzW}`


```                                                                      
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH=/challenge/more_commands/ 
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ win
It looks like 'win' was improperly launched. Don't launch it directly; it MUST 
be launched by /challenge/run!
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ /challenge/run
Invoking 'win'....
Congratulations! You properly set the flag and 'win' has launched!
