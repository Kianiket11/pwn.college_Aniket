# Setting varibles

In this challenge we need to set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QpR4qIjcViKCBn8XCsjQo3MjXFE.QX5UTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}`

As the challenge suggests we can set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE by PWN=COLLEGE.

```
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{QpR4qIjcViKCBn8XCsjQo3MjXFE.QX5UTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}
```
