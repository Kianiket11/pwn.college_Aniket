# Permission tweaking practice

In this challenge we will be asked to change the permissions of the /challenge/pwn file in specific ways a few times in a row. If we get the permissions wrong, 
the game will reset and we can try again. If we get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let us chmod /flag to make it readable for ourselves.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8b7hRijwnmY-JE8tCoTk4Tp4YTp.QXwEjN0wiM1kjNzEzW}`

As given in the challenge that we will be asked to cahnge the permissions of the file in order to get the flag. Now, here what i used was the Octal notations for 
file permissions as i felt that they were much easier to use. How this method works is for each class (user / group / other) the three permission bits have values
r = 4, w = 2, x = 1. And we add the bits for each class to get one octal digit. So each permission set rwx maps to a digit 0–7 for eg:
--- = 0
--x = 1
-w- = 2
-wx = 3 (2+1)
Therefore, by using this method i completed the challenge 8 times in a row and finally as we need read permission to read the flag i used chmod 400 /flag to give
/flag read permission in order to get the flag.

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod 400 /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag

## What I learned

I learnt about the Octal notations for file permissions and how to use them to change the file permissions.
