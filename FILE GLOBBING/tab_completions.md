# Tab completions

In this challenge the flag is copied into /challenge/pwncollege, and then we can freely cat that file. But we can't type the file name.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YFfQihXK7-M4FXsi8JUr6KVf3Bt.0FN0EzNxwiM1kjNzEzW}`

As given in the challenge we can't use the filename.Therefore, i just used the tab button to complete the file name.

```
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:/challenge$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹
pwn.college{YFfQihXK7-M4FXsi8JUr6KVf3Bt.0FN0EzNxwiM1kjNzEzW}

```

## What I learned

I learnt that tab can be used to complete any command or filename as when you hit tab shell tries to complete the command/filename.

## References
