# Finding Files
In this challege we have to find the hidden flag which is in a random directory on the filesystem. It's still called flag. 

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Y6hcWz91E6Gxv3v9L1rr1xHTHqQ.QXyMDO0wiM1kjNzEzW}`

As given in the challenge we had to find the flag which is hidden, therefore we can use the find command to find the particular 
hidden flag. After a few permission denied we can see some files, so we can just start catting the files and capture the flag.

```

## What I learned
I learned the find command and its different uses. For eg we can just use the find command and it will take the 
current working directoy and find the files, we can use find with specific location also and at last we can also use find 
to filter with name and can also search the whole filesystem just like we did with this challenge.
