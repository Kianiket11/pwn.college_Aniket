# Cat:not the pet, but the command
In this challenge we'll have to use the cat command to find the flag which is hidden in the home directory

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{w_dz70lphBH5ciONrAYo7uoTk1X.QXxcTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}`

Nothing Much in the solving part, as the challenge clearly states that we have to use the cat command to read the flag. we 
can just use the cat flag command to find the flag.

```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{w_dz70lphBH5ciONrAYo7uoTk1X.QXxcTN0wiM1kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt that cat is a commands in linux and not a pet. Cat is the shortform for concatenate,I learnt that how useful cat command 
is for reading a file in linux and how it can also read multiple files if multiple arguments are provided.

## References 
None.
